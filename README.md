## Investigating annotator bias in comment quality and incivility classification by formal education

In this study, we investigate the potential impact of annotatorsâ€™ formal education on the classification of high-quality (deliberative) and uncivil user contributions in online discussions. Using a dataset of 13,677 German user comments annotated by crowd workers with low, medium, and high formal education, we investigate potential divergences in classification outcomes as well as statistical associations between language features and the annotations of the educationally diverse groups. Our results indicate that classifiers for high-quality and uncivil comments yield significantly different results when trained on data labeled by annotators with varying educational backgrounds. We argue that such group-specific differences should be considered when developing machine learning models in both practice and research to reflect a more inclusive understanding of comment quality and incivility.
